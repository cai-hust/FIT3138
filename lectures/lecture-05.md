#### Financial accounting

  state of the firm.
- Using documented transactions to create reports for external parties and
  agencies.

  of various agencies.

#### Managerial accounting

- Ensure accounts accurate and up-to-date.
- Making "Closing" entries and "Adjusting" entries.
- 2 Common financial reports: Balance sheets and Income statements.

##### Balance sheet

- Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  - Assets: Current assets: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory
    - Long-term assets such as Building, Plant & Equipment, Land
  - Liabilities: Amounts owed to vendors, banks, and other creditors.
  - Equity: Amounts owners have invested in the company.

##### Income statement

- Profit and loss (P&L) statement
- Shows company's sales, cost of sales, and profit or loss for a period of time
  (typically a quarter or year).

### Managerial accounting

#### Provide managers with detailed information

- To make informed decisions
- To create budgets
- To determine profitability

#### Information that managers use to control day-to-day activities

- To develop operational plans
- To handle different managerial issues

## Using ERP for Accounting Information

### Problems associated with unintegrated systems

- Data sharing usually did not occur in real-time
  - Accounting data were often out of date
- Accounting personnel had to do significant research
- In traditional accounting, company's accounts are kept in a record called a
  **general ledger**.

### Integrated ERP systems

- ERP system, with its centralised database, avoids these problems
- Simplifies process of closing books and preparing financial statements.
- In the SAP ERP system, different modules (such as SD, MM, PP, HR, AM) cause
  transaction data to be entered into the general ledger simultaneously as when
  the business transactions occur.

## Operational Decision-Making Problem

### Credit Management

#### Credit management requires a good balance between

- Granting sufficient credit to support sales; and
- Making sure that the company does not lose too much money.

#### What it involves?

- Setting a limit on how much a customer can owe at any one time
- Monitoring that limit as orders come in and payments are received

#### Require real-time information

- Sales representative needs to be able to review an up-to-date accounts
  receivable balance when an order comes in.

#### How an integrated ERP Systems help

- Accounts receivable is immediately updated

## Product Profitability Analysis

- Business managers use accounting data to perform profitability analyses of a
  company and its products.
- When data are inaccurate or incomplete, the analyses are flawed
- Main reasons for inaccurate or incomplete data
  - Inconsistent record keeping
  - Inaccurate inventory costing systems
  - Problems consolidating data from subsidiaries.

### Inconsistent record keeping

- Each marketing divisions maintains its own records and keeps track of sales
  data differently
- Paper records might be inaccurate or missing, making validity of the final
  report questionable.
- Withing integrated information systems, accounting and reporting to management
  requires:
  - Working around limitations of information systems to produce useful output
- ERP system minimises or eliminates these problems.

### Inaccurate Inventory Costing Systems

#### Calculating inventory costs

- One of the most important and challenging accounting tasks in any
  manufacturing company.

#### ERP and inventory cost accounting

- Many companies with unintegrated accounting systems analyse their cost
  variances infrequently
- Often, they do now know how much it actually costs to produce a unit of
  product.
- With an ERP system, employees throughout the company would have recorded costs
  in a company-wide database as they occurred.
- ERP system configurations allow analysts to track costs using many bases.

#### ERP and Activity-based costing

- Accountants identify activities associated with overhead cost generation and
  then keep records on costs and on activities.
- ABC requires more bookkeeping than traditional costing methods.
